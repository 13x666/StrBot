how_to_play: |-
  This game is quest-quiz. We have a few levels there. Each of them have some characters. Thses characters can do specific actions targeting other characters on level
  
  So on, you are narrator of eaach level and you must try to make everything get to goal of each level. The problem there is that English is a bit complicates, so in game you will have strict rules what to say. First word is character, then goes verb and after target character. Example:\

  Alex finds key

  It's hard to foresee all possible language structure, so to make game playable we had to make this rules
